FinanceMyLife, a Web based application that shows you the next steps after college graduation

Using HTML and Javascript, a user provides their future occupation, their dream city, and their student debt. 
FML then calculates how much of their salary would be taken by living costs, broken down into helpful categories.
Finally, FML recommends a city to the user based on their stated preferences. 
Options are given to them to explore the data and find the best results.
